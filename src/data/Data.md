## Review

### Synopsis
A story of a villain, Fang Yuan who was reborn 500 years into the past with the Spring Autumn Cicada he painstakingly refined. With his profound wisdom, battle and life experiences, he seeks to overcome his foes with skill and wit! Ruthless and amoral, he has no need to hold back as he pursues his ultimate goals. In a world of cruelty where one cultivates using Gu – [magical creatures of the world] – Fang Yuan must rise up above all with his own power.

### Review
A compelling read that strays from the standard xianxia/xuanhuan trope. Gu Zhen Ren narrates a story with a completely developed character in a word that has one of the best story building in modern day stories. Every volume ends with a bang and keeps the reader interested

### Character Analysis
Gu Yue Fang Yuan is a ruthless cold calculating human who chooses benefits and resources over everything else. Rules, allies, enemies, good, evil—these are all just concepts that are exploited for the sole goal of personal advancement. We witness him utilizing any means necessary like blackmailing, stealing, betrayal, alliances with former enemies for the sake of achieving his goal of an eternal life.

### World Building
The supporting characters are rich and the world building is great. Every character other than the protagonist is dynamic with their own thoughts and personalities, a topic usually overlooked in standard xianxia/xuanhuan novels. The book never fails to surprise and every plot twist keeps you engaged. The world is split into 5 regions with each of them having their own cultures and traditions. The world is generally aligned into either the righteous path or the demonic path with the line demarcating them ever blurry.

### Themes & Ideas
The novel addresses and talks about ideas such as destiny, power, individuality, death, rebellion against fate and perseverance. One of the most interesting aspects is that Fang Yuan as a character has no redemption arc or anything along those lines. Rather than talking about a character that keeps on developing, this novel takes an already developed character and tells the story from his perspective.

### Criticism
There are a few minor issues with the novel. Like any other standard web novel, the same concept is explained again and again and again to keep the reader interested. Also a few arcs like the northern plains arc could have been cut short drastically without affecting the storyline at all. The translations at some parts are iffy at the best

### Final Thoughts
Overall a fun read that could make the reader think and potentially change the way the reader looks at life.

# The Fifth Science

## Review

### Synopsis
The Galactic Human Empire was built atop four sciences: logic, physics, psychology, and sociology. Standing on those pillars, humans spent 100,000 years spreading out into the galaxy: warring, exploring, partying — the usual. Then there was the fifth science. And that killed the empire stone dead. The Fifth Science is a collection of 12 stories, beginning at the start of the Galactic Human Empire and following right through to its final days. We'll see some untypical things along the way, meet some untypical folk: galactic lighthouses from the distant future, alien tombs from the distant past, murderers, emperors, archaeologists and drunks; mad mathematicians attempting to wake the universe itself up.

### Review
A collection of short stories that are loosely connected. An amazing read that deals with humanity, existentialism, philosophy and morality in a quirky humorous way. The story is based on how the fifth science led to the fall of the galactic human empire that spanned across hundreds of thousands of units of space and time. Each of the short stories deals with different aspects of human existence and provokes thoughts while still being simple and straightforward.

### Themes & Ideas
Deals with complex topics such as being human, making sentient beings conscious, human existence in simple stories that are thought provoking and easy to understand at the same time. Ideas such as the entire galaxy being a sentient thought entity with each of the star being a processing unit [which kinda makes sense if you've read about artificial neural networks] are discussed in the same quirky energetic manner like the content in exurb1a's youtube channel

### Criticism
Some stories are breathtaking and insanely thought provoking. But some of them are just plain boring and bring down the standards of the rest of the book. There is also the issue of generalisation and trying to explain grand things that can't be explained using current technology by trying to force them into current standards. [disclaimer - The author might be a sex offender, but I believe in the separation of the book and it's author and the review won't change irrespective of the ruling]

### Final Thoughts
A good read for people of any age. Extremely thought provoking and not recommended unless the reader is willing to spend time on making peace with their existential crisis and sense of self.



# Beyond Good and Evil
- **Author:** Friedrich Nietzsche
- **Rating:** 8
- **Image:** Resources/BeyondGoodAndEvil/beyondGoodAndEvil.jpg
- **Slug:** beyond-good-and-evil

## Review

### Synopsis
Beyond Good and Evil is a comprehensive overview of Nietzsche's mature philosophy. The book consists of 296 aphorisms, ranging in length from a few sentences to a few pages. These aphorisms are grouped thematically into nine different chapters and are bookended by a preface and a poem.

### Review
Beyond good and evil is just an angry old man's ramblings against society. But this rambling in itself is interesting and fun to read. The book feels like an anthology of similarly themed rants of a sad man who's had too much time to think about life, morals and society. The poem in the end is an amazing take on friendship and individuality.

### Themes & Ideas
Deals with topics such as morals, how morals affect society, how 'herd' mentality is prevalent in society, how individuality is more important than social norms. The 'noble' part of his work that says how everyone is on a quest to make their own sense of this chaotic world resonates with my own sense of understanding of how this world works. His criticism against religion is an interesting take on how people lose their individuality.

### Criticism
Nietzsche was a misogynist. Though progressiveish for his time, the time held him back. There was also this added layer of sophistication that was not necessary and ruined the meaning of the book.

### Final Thoughts
Good place to get started into reading books on philosophy. Would recommend using a helper book if it feels too complicated for your first read.



# Lord of the Mysteries

## Review

### Synopsis
Set with the historical backdrop of an alternate 19th century Victorian London, the protagonist Zhou Mingrui finds himself having transmigrated into the body of Klein Moretti, a recent history graduate in Tingen City. Faced with perplexing mysteries and strange, supernatural events, he quickly realizes things are not what they appear. Filled with cannons, battleships, steam engines, and factories, as well as divination, potions, tarot cards, sealed artifacts, and superhumans known as Beyonders, Klein finds himself the unwitting leader of a secret organization, known only to his followers as 'The Fool'. Join Klein as he becomes a Beyonder, advancing in power and uncovering the mysteries of the world.

### Review
Lord of the mysteries is an excellent book that deals with the question what does it mean to be a human. Zhou Mingrui gets transmigrated into the body of Klein Moretti, in a world that recently entered the industrial age. In the presence of beings of supernatural entities, this is the story of Klein's apotheosis from a human to a God told in the perspective of Klein himself. Book written in a cthulhu mythos format and heavily references to norse mythology. The book also has heavy references to occult sciences.

### Character Analysis
Klein Moretti is a calm, cautious and a good natured human. Fundamentally being a follower of justice, He chooses to side with justice even at personal cost. We see how Klein changes from a slightly indecisive cautious newbie to someone more ruthless, confident, and mysterious compared to his former mentality. Even so, he preserves the core of his personality as one who is cautious, yet will uphold justice where necessary and not involve or target the innocent.

### World Building
LotM is a book with great supporting characters and a rich world that doesn't cease to surprise. All the characters have their own personalities, their traits, their quirks and their values that makes them feel real and multi-dimensional. The characters are varied and show live in the perspective of all the different people in 18th centuryish England

### Themes & Ideas
Deals with topics like what it means to be human, till what point can a being with godlike powers can be considered human, the difference in the lifestyles of people belonging to different classes in industrial England, fate and even how everything bestowed comes with a price. Thought provoking and and at the same time entertaining as a story

### Criticism
The ending is extremely hurried and a lot of loose ends are left. This is intentional as the author plans on writing a sequel, but at the moment, it ends without a proper closure giving the invested readers who have read around 1400 chapters a sense of emptiness.

### Final Thoughts
Amazing book that's a must read for all mystery and occult fans. Extremely entertaining and captures the reader's heart. Hilarious and quirky while still keeping a sense of seriousness.



# Xian Ni {Renegade Immortal}

## Review

### Synopsis
Wang Lin is a very smart boy with loving parents. Although he and his parents are shunned by the rest of their relatives, his parents have always held high hopes that he will one day achieve greatness. One day, Wang Lin suddenly gained the chance to walk the path of an immortal but found that he only had mediocre talent at best. Watch Wang Lin as he breaks through his lack of talent and walks the path towards becoming a real immortal!

### Review
Xian Ni is a good read that doesn't follow the standard xianxia/xianhuan tropes. An intelligent read that tells the story of Wang Lin, a young filial boy who carries the hope of his family and the way the world around him that shapes him. Only negative point in the book is the HORRIBLE romance. The book would have been waaaaay better off without the romance part in it.

### Character Analysis
Wang Lin is a multidimensional character moulded by the uiverse he resides in. We witness as he changes from a naive young boy shouldering the hopes of his family to the point when he becomes a cold blooded, ruthless murderer who tries to achieve a simple goal of living a life where he isn't bounded by anyone. Even though he commits wanton acts of murder, he still retains his morals not in the sense of being a hypocrite, but in the sense of being a human.

### World Building
The world in Xian Ni is a dark and depressing one that has some coulourful parts to it. The system of power in the book is well defined and the parts that contain Wang Lin's dao comprehension as well as the mortal arcs are really good. Some of the antagonists and supporting characters are momorable and have a really strong part in the narrative process. The very start of the book lacks the sense of severity of actions that's found in the rest of the book. Some stuff do end up being inconsistent in the long run as the novel has around 2000 chapters.

### Themes & Ideas
Xian Ni tells how humans are shaped by their circumstances. In a dark, gritty world where personal power is valued that most, the characters that come out are going to be dark and gritty themselves. The books also talks about life, death and how the very knowledge of life and death of loved ones can change a person to the point that that they would become unrecognisable.

### Criticism
Horrible romance. Absolutely horrible to the extent that the romance brings down the quality of the entire book. A considerable number of plotholes that could possibly break the story. Some exaggerated details like beings of like millions of kilometers in size sorta destroy the ability that makes people imagine

### Final Thoughts
A good read for a newbie in xianxia/xuanhuan. Keeps reader engaged throughout the story. Well written characters keeps you interested. Same issue of repeating the same stuff over and over again still exists



# World Of Cultivation

## Review

### Synopsis
Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. Zuo Mo is a zombie faced low level cultivator in a minor sect of a little world. Ever since he was picked up by the sect leader two years ago, he has no memories of his earlier life except a recurring nightmare. Navigating the rigid class structure and intricacies of the cultivation world, as one of the lowest possible of the lowest class, Zuo Mo's dream is to earn money, and lots of it, through being a spiritual plant farmer. A chance occurrence reveals that someone powerful had changed Zuo's features and erased his mind. The money grubbing zombie decides to set out on a journey of cultivation to find out answers. Fate colludes with chance, the drums of war are beating, the ghost of his past is coming…

### Review
World of cultivation is a fresh xianxia that shows how good a web novel could be if the author chooses to actually plot out the story instead of fleshing it out. The novel doesn't suffer from the standard cliched hero and 1D characters. It has some creative ideas along with memorable recurring characters. We see the protagonist Zuo Mo who started off farming, preferring a life of earning money, enter the world of martial arts and cultivation and creating his own force that could decide the fate of the world.

### Character Analysis
Shameless. Thick-skinned. Money-minded. Shrewd. The protagonist is realistic and lifelike. When compared to Wei Sheng, who seems more of a standard xianxia protagonist with his "unyielding will" and sword talent, Zuo Mo spends his time thinking of making money. His existence is like a breath of fresh air when compared to the standard xianxia novel.

### World Building
As a novel with "World of Cultivation" in its title, it delivers. Great world building with memorable characters that don't feel bland. No one or no group exactly feels like an antagonistic entity. Each character is driven by their own motivation. But the author fails to keep up with the expanding world building in the end and ends up losing the main factor that kept the book interesting and different from its peers.

### Themes & Ideas
Main ideology in the book is conflict and wars. It tells a tale of the pitiful existence of an individual when faced against the tides of war. It's also a tale of friendship, humour and faction building. The story has a very "human" feeling in it.

### Criticism
A very hurried ending. Quite a few plot holes in the magic system that's being used. Poor romance and missed chances. Feels as if the author who finished the second half of the book was a different one. A lot of plot holes that could break the experience of the book. Some characters are introduced and then forgotten. Quite a number of characters, including the sect leaders of the MC are just killed off in the background, making the plot feel like it's barely held together.

### Final Thoughts
Standard example of a book with a good theory and idea coupled with bad execution.



# The Strongest System

## Review

### Synopsis
"Yours Truly shall have all of you bow down to me!" Arriving in this brand-new world, Lin Fan found himself in possession of a system which allows him to level up indefinitely unbounded by the limitations of this world. Upon learning a powerful technique of Monkey Steals Peaches, Lin Fan realises that he's poised to literally become the strongest person in this entire world. But of course, how boring would that be unless the whole world gets to know about his great name? Shameless. Righteous. Smart. Lin Fan will let no one stand in his way to glory!

### Review
Hilarious, funny and crass. A book not meant to be enjoyed by everyone. The author utilizes crass jokes from shooting down a god with a giant OP dildo, to using custom viagra to make the lightning striking him "run out of juice", to dressing up Chicky in an inflatable T-rex costume. Hilarious book that remains enjoyable even though some of the arcs tend to be repeated.

### Character Analysis
'HOW BRAZEN' 'I'M BRAZEN?! 'YOURS TRULY IS A GOD AMONGST MEN' 'ALL HAIL THE MOTHERF*CKING HUAM KING'. Lin Fan's lack of self-reflection - or rather, his incredible ability to rationalize all of his ridiculous decisions - is one of the best selling points of this webnovel. The character is willing to do anything to progress in his cultivation. Kicking other's balls, and even kicking his own balls. The reader will end up liking this narcissistic self serving goofball of a protagonist

### World Building
World Building is one of the worst parts in the book. Not that it's bad. But the fact that it could have been better. Waay better. Main character ends up jumping from one realm to another after 'ascending'. The 1000 races is a huge missed opportunity. All things considered, it still ends up having better world building than most of the other web novels out there. The side characters in this webnovel are a blast. Reverend Shakya with his huge chest, chicky the tailless phoenix and even Yao wuxie with his undefeatable fart are not forgettable

### Themes & Ideas
A boorish book written in a vulgar language that has a few serious moments here and there. The gap in the protagonist's attitude makes all the serious matters feel real and also makes the readers sympathise with the protagonist. The ending of the book is poetically tragic and does justice to the story.

### Criticism
Lots of missed potential. A few arcs seem repetitive. Loads of fillers. Not that the fillers aren't enjoyable, but that the fillers end up derailing the main story

### Final Thoughts
Amazing read if you're up for crass humour and jokes.

## Review

### Synopsis
This is the story of a crazy lich who possesses an internal game system and brings catastrophe to the entire world. "Let's look at the daily quests today… it's the damned choose one-of-two-options-type again. Destroy a town with a population of 30,000 people or above; reward: 10,000 evil points. Steal lollipops from 3 children; reward: 1 evil point. If neither of the quests is completed, then 2 points will be deducted." "Tsk! You think I'm stupid? If I really destroyed a town, a crusade of Myth-ranked Holy Knights would definitely come hunting me down. Even if I earned the points, there wouldn't be any life left in me to spend them. I better just go be a kindly lollipop bandit." I've already had enough of being a notorious lich. Who says a lich can't be a good person? I'm definitely going to beat this damned system and be an upright and dignified good man

### Review
Hilarious, quirky and light hearted. The plot is genius, and the comedy neat. The story is engaging and commands attention. A few minor plot holes, but they end up being filled by the author. Every action has a sense of effect in the universe and keeps you on your toes. The story is a mixture of humour, DnD and 4th wall breaking references that leaves you in awe with the breadth of the story.

### Character Analysis
The protagonist Roland Mist starts off as a "Lich" in the story. We see an almost mature MC who's in his 4th reincarnation. Cursed with the aura of misfortune, we see him muttering "Are we the bad guys" even while saving the world. 'What is reputation? Can I eat it?' pretty much sums up his attitude towards the world.

### World Building
The world building is one of THE best parts about this webnovel. The side characters pretty much make the entire narrative more lively and interesting. A nudist cult, an explosive maniac, sociopathic scientists, goblins with their "safe" brand, a furry loving dracon who f*cks anything and everything and doesnt even spare a sandworm from Dune, Krose whose gender is Krose, an alchemist whose concoctions are so dangerous she doesn't dare to drink them and a merry band of "gentlemen".

### Themes & Ideas
Despite the humorous background, the book carries a heavy story about betrayal, love, struggle against destiny, mortality and free-will versus the greater good. We see the classic man v/s world thingy

### Criticism
Some abrupt jumps in the storytelling leads to inconsistency. Minor plot holes.

### Final Thoughts
One of the best CN fusion novels out there. Highly recommended if you have any experience with DnD.

## Review

### Synopsis
Chang An, capital of Tang, the most powerful empire in the continent. A heaven wrecking massacre shook the city to its core. Amidst the incident, a young boy named Ning Que managed to get away, dug out from a pile of corpses along with a little girl called Sang Sang. Years passed, and since that day the two of them have lived together. Together with Sang Sang they both entered the military, with plausible military achievements, they were recommended into the Scholar School, which began their miraculous journey.Who is this boy and what does his future hold? The epic and legendary tale of an extraordinary young man rising up from the masses, traversing his life in the pursuit of quantity over quality. His inquisitive voice echoes infinitely through the hills of the immortal Academy: "I am one who would rather suffer an eternity of destined calamities than beg for solace from the saints"

### Review
A good plot narrated in an amazing writing style. The story revolves around the son of Yama, the harbinger of an everlasting night. The protagonist joins the "Academy" and learns from the Headmaster [Confucius]. The story starts off slowly and puts a lot of detail into the world building. The story mimics real life and feels more political rather than the standard "I stronger,I rules the world hur hur" shenanigan seen in most CN webnovels

### Character Analysis
The protagonist Ning Que is a teenager who starts off being unable to cultivate yet being amazing in calligraphy as well as having an acute sense for battles. A shameless man who was brought up by tragedies and battles. The only person he trusts is his handmaiden who's been living with him from when they were kids. He's willing to kill even the innocents to protect his friends and family.

### World Building
A world with characters that are alive and impact the world. Each side character could be the protagonist of his/her own novel. Every character has a backstory and feels human. The 12 senior brothers and sisters of the academy, the world wayfarers, the three addicts, the gods of the western divine hill, the buddhist monks, the drunkard and the butcher, the strongest human Liu Bai and even Hao Tian[The Heavens] bring life to the story.

### Themes & Ideas
The conflict between Man v/s God is fleshed out. Politics and their effects on the life of normal people.

### Criticism
Lots of unneeded sexism. Also a creepy love story which basically feels like grooming. A very blurry power system.

### Final Thoughts
One of those novels filled with politics. A bit slow paced, but gives a feeling of depth. The novel seems more enjoyable if some history about the Tang dynasty is known to the reader. Worthy of a read
