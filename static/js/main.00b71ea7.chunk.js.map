Gu Zhen Ren narrates a story with a completely developed character in a word that has one of the best story building in modern day stories. Every volume ends with a bang and keeps the reader interested\",\n        protagonist:\"Gu Yue Fang Yuan is a ruthless cold calculating human who chooses benefits and resources over everything else. Rules, allies, enemies, good, evil—these are all just concepts that are exploited for the sole goal of personal advancement. We witness him utilizing any means necessary like blackmailing, stealing, betrayal, alliances with former enemies for the sake of achieving his goal of an eternal life.\",\n        charactersAndWorld:\"The supporting characters are rich and the world building is great. Every character other than the protagonist is dynamic with their own thoughts and personalities, a topic usually overlooked in standard xianxia/xuanhuan novels. The book never fails to surprise and every plot twist keeps you engaged. The world is split into 5 regions with each of them having their own cultures and traditions. The world is generally aligned into either the righteous path or the demonic path with the line demarcating them ever blurry.\",\n        addresses:\"The novel addresses and talks about ideas such as destiny, power, individuality, death, rebellion against fate and perseverance. One of the most interesting aspects is that Fang Yuan as a character has no redemption arc or anything along those lines. Rather than talking about a character that keeps on developing, this novel takes an already developed character and tells the story from his perspective.\",\n        cons:\"There are a few minor issues with the novel. Like any other standard web novel, the same concept is explained again and again and again to keep the reader interested. Also a few arcs like the northern plains arc could have been cut short drastically without affecting the storyline at all.

Standing on those pillars, humans spent 100,000 years spreading out into the galaxy: warring, exploring, partying — the usual. Then there was the fifth science. And that killed the empire stone dead. The Fifth Science is a collection of 12 stories, beginning at the start of the Galactic Human Empire and following right through to its final days. We’ll see some untypical things along the way, meet some untypical folk: galactic lighthouses from the distant future, alien tombs from the distant past, murderers, emperors, archaeologists and drunks; mad mathematicians attempting to wake the universe itself up.\",\n        slug:\"fifth-science\",\n        rating:9,\n        review:\"A collection of short stories that are loosely connected. An amazing read that deals with humanity, existentialism, philosophy and morality in a quirky humorous way. The story is based on how the fifth science led to the fall of the galactic human empire that spanned across hundreds of thousands of units of space and time. Each of the short stories deals with different aspects of human existence and provokes thoughts while still being simple and straightforward.\",\n        addresses:\"Deals with complex topics such as being human, making sentient beings conscious, human existence in simple stories that are thought provoking and easy to understand at the same time. Ideas such as the entire galaxy being a sentient thought entity with each of the star being a processing unit [which kinda makes sense if you’ve read about artificial neural networks] are discussed in the same quirky energetic manner like the content in exurb1a’s youtube channel\",\n        cons:\"Some stories are breathtaking and insanely thought provoking. But some of them are just plain boring and bring down the standards of the rest of the book. There is also the issue of generalisation and trying to explain grand things that can’t be explained using current technology by trying to force them into current standards. [disclaimer - The author might be a sex offender, but I believe in the separation of the book and it’s author and the review won’t change irrespective of the ruling]\",\n        judgement:\"A good read for people of any age.

The poem in the end is an amazing take on friendship and individuality.\",\n        addresses:\"Deals with topics such as morals, how morals affect society, how ‘herd’ mentality is prevalent in society, how individuality is more important than social norms. The ‘noble’ part of his work that says how everyone is on a quest to make their own sense of this chaotic world resonates with my own sense of understanding of how this world works.

The book also has heavy references to occult sciences.\",\n        protagonist:\"Klein Moretti is a calm, cautious and a good natured human. Fundamentally being a follower of justice, He chooses to side with justice even at personal cost. We see how Klein changes from a slightly indecisive cautious newbie to someone more ruthless, confident, and mysterious compared to his former mentality.

Thought provoking and and at the same time entertaining as a story\",\n        cons:\"The ending is extremely hurried and a lot of loose ends are left.

Even though he commits wanton acts of murder, he still retains his morals not in the sense of being a hypocrite, but in the sense of being a human.\",\n        charactersAndWorld:\"The world in Xian Ni is a dark and depressing one that has some coulourful parts to it. The system of power in the book is well defined and the parts that contain Wang Lin's dao comprehension as well as the mortal arcs are really good. Some of the antagonists and supporting characters are momorable and have a really strong part in the narrative process. The very start of the book lacks the sense of severity of actions that's found in the rest of the book. Some stuff do end up being inconsistent in the long run as the novel has around 2000 chapters.\",\n        addresses:\"Xian Ni tells how humans are shaped by their circumstances. In a dark, gritty world where personal power is valued that most, the characters that come out are going to be dark and gritty themselves.
